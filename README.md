# Decode
It's mainly about how I processed the raw data of GWAS of plasma protein levels measured with 4,907 aptamers in 35,559 Icelanders (Ferkingstad et al. 2021 _Nature genetics_)

The origin 4907 files were stored in /NiuHe/decode.is/ on LargeBlack.
1881 files(aptamers) out of 4907 files(aptamers) contain cis-signal accroding to the supplementary table 2 of the paper.

The processed data were stored in /opt/storage/deCODE_formatted/zhijian/somascan_data on LargeBlack.
